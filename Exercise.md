# Exercise: Demonstration of Prompt Files and Documentation Generation

This exercise guides you through the process of using Copilot custom instructions and prompt files to generate high-quality documentation for a Java Spring Boot project. You will learn how to create, apply, and compare custom instructions, and leverage blueprint prompts for architectural documentation.

---

## 1. Create a Custom Instructions File

- **Action:** Use Copilot → Settings → Instructions in VS Code to create a custom instructions file.
- **Purpose:** This file defines how Copilot should behave, what coding standards to follow, and any project-specific rules.
- **Example:**
  - Specify technology stack (e.g., Spring Boot 3.5.0, Java 17)
  - Enforce layered architecture and DDD principles
  - Require Javadoc comments and code quality checks

---

## 2. Generate the Custom Instructions File Using a Blueprint Prompt

- **Action:** Use the custom prompt `copilot-instructions-blueprint-generator` to generate a new instructions file.
- **Purpose:** This prompt guides Copilot to analyze the codebase and produce a tailored instructions file based on actual project patterns and best practices.
- **Example Output:**
  - `.github/copilot-instructions.md` containing technology detection, architectural consistency rules, and documentation standards

---

## 3. Compare the Two Instructions Files

- **Action:** Review and compare the manually created instructions file with the one generated by the blueprint prompt.
- **Purpose:** Assess the capability of custom prompts to:
  - Detect technology stack automatically
  - Enforce architectural and coding standards
  - Provide actionable guidance for Copilot
- **Comparison Criteria:**
  - Coverage of project-specific rules
  - Consistency with actual codebase
  - Depth of architectural analysis
  - Quality of generated documentation guidance

---

## 4. Generate Architecture Documents Using the Custom Prompt

- **Action:** Use the custom prompt `architecture-blueprint-generator` to generate comprehensive architecture documentation.
- **Purpose:** Automatically produce a detailed architecture blueprint, including:
  - Technology stack analysis
  - C4 diagrams (System, Container, Component)
  - Domain model and data architecture
  - Security, quality attributes, and implementation patterns
- **Example Output:**
  - `Project_Architecture_Blueprint.md` with in-depth architectural analysis and diagrams

---

## Summary

By following this exercise, you will:
- Understand the workflow for creating and applying Copilot custom instructions
- See the power of blueprint prompts in generating project-specific documentation
- Learn to compare manual and automated documentation approaches
- Produce high-quality architecture documents for your project

**Recommended Next Steps:**
- Experiment with different prompt files for other documentation types (e.g., design specs, how-to guides)
- Refine custom instructions to better match your team's standards
- Use generated documentation as a foundation for onboarding and future development
